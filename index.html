<a id="well-fargo-data-analytics-competition" class="anchor" href="#well-fargo-data-analytics-competition" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Well Fargo Data Analytics Competition</h3>

<p>The Project was created as a part of competition organized by Wells Fargo. The data set consisted of 220,337 posts taken from both FaceBook and Twitter with mediatype specified. The posts contained discussions around four major banks called BankA, BankB, BankC and BankD. The only guideline for competitors was that the analysis needed to be innovative and interesting. </p>

<a id="our-team" class="anchor" href="#our-team" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our team</h3>

<p>The data analysis was a group effort. Our team consisted of 3 students:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/mikaelarae" class="user-mention">@mikaelarae</a> - Major: Sociology minoring in Data Science;</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/tiffanirgriffith" class="user-mention">@tiffanirgriffith</a> - Major: Math and undegrad in Marine Biology;</li>
</ul>

<a id="strategy" class="anchor" href="#strategy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Strategy</h3>

<p>Our group was intterested in finding what people say about their experience with given banks when it came to international transactions, travelling and being abroad.</p>

<p>The first step we took was to subset the dateframe into separate dataframes by the bank name and the presense of the following words:
"abroad" and "foreign".</p>

<p>Once the dataset was devided into 4 subsets, we then used a modified sentiment analysis. The list of negative words taken from <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/%7Eliub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html*">http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html*</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews." 
Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge 
Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle, 
Washington, USA. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides the list of negative words provided from this source, we added a list of words with negative connotation specifically imposed by bank customers. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Charge
Carged
Charging
....
Overdraft
Overdrafted
Overdrafting
...
Widthdraw
Widthdrawal
Widthdrew
...
</code></pre>

<p>The following graphs reflect the very negative/positive score per bank as a result of sentiment analysis:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ndFHffH1fF4/VmCSXZTIV9I/AAAAAAAAA5c/4KqIMLHdoyQ/s712-Ic42/Pos%252528Bank_C%252529.png" alt="Positive Bank B"></p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MADTYAzQ8MA/VmCSXmiWBiI/AAAAAAAAA5g/5cziQcECgcc/s712-Ic42/Pos%252528Bank_D%252529.png" alt="Positive Back D"></p>

<p>As shown in the graphs, Bank C had the highest Negative score, which means its customers were more dissappointed with internatioinal transactions than the customers of other banks. Bank A got the highest poitive score, which means that customers of Bank A were more satisfied with their international experience than others. However, when comparing Bank A's positive (0.6) and negative (0.68) scores, they are nearly equal. Thus, when considering results of sentiment score, it makes more sense to make cunclusions based on positive/negative ratio. In case of Bank A it equals to 0.88 (with 1 representing 50%/50% relationships).</p>

<p>When further investigating scores, in case of all 4 banks, posts tend to contain more negative lexicon than positive. The numbers are distributed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>**Bank A: **
Total negative score: 0.68
Total positive score: 0.6
Positive/Negative ratio: 0.88

**Bank B: **
Total negative score: 0.62
Total positive score: 0.45
Positive/Negative ratio: 0.73

**Bank C: **
Total negative score: 0.805
Total positive score: 0.425
Positive/Negative ratio: 0.53

**Bank D: **
Total negative score: 0.57
Total positive score: 0.34
Positive/Negative ratio: 0.60
</code></pre>

<p>Bank B has the biggest negative ratio, versus Bank D having the biggest positive one. This concludes, that according to the sentiment analysis, customers of Bank B were more dissapointed with their bank's performance than customers of other banks, and customers of Bank D were more satisfied with their bank than customers of other banks.</p>
