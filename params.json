{"name":"Wells-fargo-data-competition","tagline":"","body":"## Well Fargo Data Analytics Competition\r\nThe Project was created as a part of competition organized by Wells Fargo. The data set consisted of 220,337 posts taken from both FaceBook and Twitter with mediatype specified. The posts contained discussions around four major banks called BankA, BankB, BankC and BankD. The only guideline for competitors was that the analysis needed to be innovative and interesting. \r\n\r\n## Our team\r\nThe data analysis was a group effort. Our team consisted of 3 students:\r\n* @mikaelarae - Major: Sociology minoring in Data Science;\r\n* @tiffanirgriffith - Major: Math and undegrad in Marine Biology;\r\n\r\n## Strategy\r\nOur group was interested in finding what people say about their experience with given banks when it came to international transactions, travelling and being abroad.\r\n\r\nThe first step we took was to subset the dateframe into separate dataframes by the bank name and the presense of the following words:\r\n\"abroad\" and \"foreign\".\r\n\r\n```R\r\nbankA.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"BankA\",x)))\r\nbankB.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"BankB\",x)))\r\nbankC.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"BankC\",x)))\r\nbankD.idx = which(sapply(df$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"BankD\",x)))\r\n\r\ndf.bankA=df[bankA.idx,]\r\ndf.bankA\r\nabroad.idx=which(sapply(df.bankA$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"abroad\",x)))\r\nabroad.idx\r\n\r\nforeign.idx=which(sapply(df.banka$FullText,function(x) grepl(\"foreign\",x)))\r\nforeign.idx\r\n\r\ndf.final1=df.banka[abroad.idx,]\r\ndf.final2=df.banka[foreign.idx,]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the dataset was devided into 4 subsets, we then used a modified sentiment analysis. The list of negative words taken from http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html*\r\n\r\n> *Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. \"Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews.\" \r\n> Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge \r\n> Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle, \r\n> Washington, USA. \r\n\r\nBesides the list of negative words provided from this source, we added a list of words with negative connotation specifically imposed by bank customers. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCharge\r\nCarged\r\nCharging\r\n....\r\nOverdraft\r\nOverdrafted\r\nOverdrafting\r\n...\r\nWidthdraw\r\nWidthdrawal\r\nWidthdrew\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following graphs reflect the very negative/positive score per bank as a result of sentiment analysis:\r\n\r\n![Negatibe BankA](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4HiKd7BmSnI/VmCSWySLGxI/AAAAAAAAA5M/oS2nBB8JaNk/s683-Ic42/Neg%252528Bank_A%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Negative Bank B](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BDKj-rUQuOo/VmCSWz3ZHjI/AAAAAAAAA5o/gjK_bg0yPLU/s683-Ic42/Neg%252528Bank_B%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Negative Bank C](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mmO8xLbdcm4/VmCSXNac26I/AAAAAAAAA5Y/st4LuxxFHO0/s683-Ic42/Neg%252528Bank_C%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Negative Bank D](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M5njmsU5D8U/VmCSXHpJZII/AAAAAAAAA5k/pb-T7tIpI0s/s712-Ic42/Neg%252528Bank_D%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Positive Bank A](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Kk1RYvBJKNg/VmCSXR8i7_I/AAAAAAAAA5U/47JGo6Bl_SA/s712-Ic42/Pos%252528Bank_A%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Posite Bank B](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EXndilXNOZ0/VmCSXZXZztI/AAAAAAAAA5Q/YGTAU7Z1zjg/s712-Ic42/Pos%252528Bank_B%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Positive Bank B](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ndFHffH1fF4/VmCSXZTIV9I/AAAAAAAAA5c/4KqIMLHdoyQ/s712-Ic42/Pos%252528Bank_C%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Positive Back D](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MADTYAzQ8MA/VmCSXmiWBiI/AAAAAAAAA5g/5cziQcECgcc/s712-Ic42/Pos%252528Bank_D%252529.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs shown in the graphs, Bank C had the highest Negative score, which means its customers were more dissappointed with internatioinal transactions than the customers of other banks. Bank A got the highest poitive score, which means that customers of Bank A were more satisfied with their international experience than others. However, when comparing Bank A's positive (0.6) and negative (0.68) scores, they are nearly equal. Thus, when considering results of sentiment score, it makes more sense to make cunclusions based on positive/negative ratio. In case of Bank A it equals to 0.88 (with 1 representing 50%/50% relationships).\r\n\r\nWhen further investigating scores, in case of all 4 banks, posts tend to contain more negative lexicon than positive. The numbers are distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Bank A: **\r\nTotal negative score: 0.68\r\nTotal positive score: 0.6\r\nPositive/Negative ratio: 0.88\r\n\r\n**Bank B: **\r\nTotal negative score: 0.62\r\nTotal positive score: 0.45\r\nPositive/Negative ratio: 0.73\r\n\r\n**Bank C: **\r\nTotal negative score: 0.805\r\nTotal positive score: 0.425\r\nPositive/Negative ratio: 0.53\r\n\r\n**Bank D: **\r\nTotal negative score: 0.57\r\nTotal positive score: 0.34\r\nPositive/Negative ratio: 0.60\r\n```\r\n\r\nBank B has the biggest negative ratio, versus Bank D having the biggest positive one. This concludes, that according to the sentiment analysis, customers of Bank B were more dissapointed with their bank's performance than customers of other banks, and customers of Bank D were more satisfied with their bank than customers of other banks.\r\n\r\n## Additional exploration\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to have a look at the most frequently used words in all the 4 subsets.\r\nTo do that we will need to make sure the following packages are installed: \"SnowballCC\", \"RColorBrewer\", \"tm\", \"ggplot2\", \"wordcloud\",\"cluster\", \"igraph\", \"fpc\", \"biclust\":\r\n\r\n```R\r\npackages_to_install <- c(\"SnowballCC\", \"RColorBrewer\", \"tm\", \"ggplot2\", \"wordcloud\",\"cluster\", \"igraph\", \"fpc\", \"biclust\")   \r\ninstall.packages(Needed, dependencies=TRUE)\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"Rcampdf\", repos = \"http://datacube.wu.ac.at/\", type = \"source\")    \r\n\r\nlibrary(tm)\r\nlibrary(SnowballC)   \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create the Corpus:\r\n\r\n```R\r\ncorpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(df.banka$FullText))\r\ncorpus\r\n```\r\nand to clean it up:convert to lower case, remove numbers, remove the most common words (like \"the\") that don't need to be counted, remove punctuation, strip the space, trim, and, finally, cooonvert it to a plain text document:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nclean_corpus <- tm_map(corpus, tolower)\r\nclean_corpus <- tm_map(clean_corpus, removeNumbers)\r\nclean_corpus <- tm_map(clean_corpus, removeWords, stopwords('english'))\r\nclean_corpus <- tm_map(clean_corpus, removePunctuation)\r\nclean_corpus <- tm_map(clean_corpus, stripWhitespace)\r\nclean_corpus <- tm_map(clean_corpus, trim)\r\nclean_corpus <- tm_map(clean_corpus, PlainTextDocument)\r\n```\r\nAnd finally, to be able to run the word frequencies, it is necessary to create the DocumentTermMatrix:\r\n\r\n```R\r\ndtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(clean_corpus)\r\n``` \r\nGiven that the data set is quite big, the minimum term frequency was set as 800 for each bank. Using the df.banka data set, the findFreqTerms() gives the following results for each bank:\r\n\r\n### Bank A\r\n```R\r\n [1] \"account\"       \"anyone\"        \"arena\"         \"bank\"
